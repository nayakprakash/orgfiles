** Low grade cite:Righi2015                            :lowgradeogs:rizzoli:
of 20 low grade ogs with <50% high grade areas, 11 got chemo and 9 did
not, bth did equally good. Fibroblastic hight grade (vis a vis
osteblastic in conventional ogs) were more common. And mean age was
also higher. Final recommendation was no chemo if high grade area <50
% according to Broder's grading.
** Amutation vs Salvage
Need a sensitive and specific pre op predictor of response and a
randomization of borderline salvageable cases into amputation vs
salvage for a direct answer.(Kumta, JBST,2016). Would early amputation
of large volume disease improve their survival?

SUV<=2.5 or SUV 2/1<= 0.5 good prognostic factor
*** JBST Rangarajan
Role in staging :90 % vs 81% sensitivity in pickup of bone mets
95 vs 25 for lymph node mets
More sensitive than MDP bone scan for peri metaphyseal mets
Role in response assessment :Kinetic data or dynamic PET

*** stage 1:
improving survival: CONPADRI and COMPADRI 1 to 3,T7 Rosen, Eilber
*** Stage 2 :
consoloditaing the role of NACT: T10,MIOS
POG8651 compared NACT to post op chemo with no change in PFS or rate
of LSS
*** stage 3 :
Necrosis predicting  prognosis IOR, COSS, EOI
*** stage 4:
Intensifying necrosis COSS 86, T12 showing better necrosis but same
survival.
INT-0133 only trial to show benefit
*** stage 5:
Intra arterial : cisplatin, benefit with fractures or NV involvement,
but only temporal , not qualitative
*** stage 6: Non HD Mtx
St Jude, Pathak et al, Bajpai et al not worse.
No head to head randomised comparison to HD MTx
*** cell surface antigenâ€‹ on OGS cells ALCAM hybrid polymerized liposomal nanoconjugate
*** thiotepa and ASCT in relapsed OGS had 40 % OS at 3Y and 25 % PFS

* History of Megaprosthesis                              :history:prosthesis:
Cosmos and Damian 3rd Century AD

* Infection in megaprosthesis
* Silver coated prosthesis
Agluna process, silver absorbed on anodized Ti oxide surface oits,
which are imperfections due to machinations or grain boundaries.Silver
with Ti is static for Pseudomonas and MRSA, cidal for epidermidis
,pyogenes and E coli.
* Prosthesis in Kids  Expandable and Other

3000 rom leads to 0.23mm per min  

Usually indicated in 12 or younger. In >12 smooth tibial fixed hinge
component may preserve some tibial physeal growth.

** Tibia issues with expandable: 
Use of rotating hinge with magnetic expandable caused medial tibial
condyle arrest and progressive loosening in over 50 % of
cases.MarcoManfrini et al.

** Femur issues with expandable :
bone resorption with cemented and uncemented leading to revision with
press for smooth stems with tubular allograft for lengthening the
resorbed segment or with HA collar and smooth press fit stem (preferred)

* Autografts                      :irradiation:ecrt:morphometry:ihc:strength:
Autoclave, pasteurized,Liquid N2 or Irradiation
Irradiated Bone : Dead, weak , no margins , no necrosis. Loss of
strength is 9 % compared to 50 % with liquid N2 and 34 % with
autoclaving
Strength evaluated with Morphometric analysis using Fibroblast number
and collagen fibril thickness and IHC with COl1, Ki 67, p53, Caspase 3.

** Synovial Sarcoma
*** Bob Maki Study
despite NY ESO + cancer testis antigen Iplimumab had no activity in
Synovial Sarcoma specimens
** Eribulin vs Dacarbazine trial:
cite:schoffski16
OS benefit of 2 mo (13.5 vs 11.5) in a young(median age 56), fit (ECOG
0/1 in 96%) At design stage OS of Dacarbazine
group was underestimated to be at 6 mo.The survival in both groups was
better than expected.This was an unusual trial because OS instead of PFS being end point.
Most new trials have used PFS as a surrogate for OS. This trial showed
no diff in PFS but better OS. This was attributed to changes in tumor
vascularisation,metastatic potential and microenvironment changes.
This also suggest that Eribulin enhances response to sbsequent chemo,
as similar result have been seen with breast cancer.
Does this call into question if the trials using PFS were undercalled?
How does the decision of PFS vs OS before design change suddenly
change ou conclusions when the effect seen is on the same set of patients?
